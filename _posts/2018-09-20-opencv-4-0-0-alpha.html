title: OpenCV 4.0-alpha
---

<p>Dear OpenCV community,</p>

<p>We are glad to announce OpenCV 4.0 alpha release, the first intermediate release before 4.0. OpenCV 4.0 gold is expected in the end of October.</p>

<h3>What’s new:</h3>

<p>First of all, 4.0 alpha includes all the latest improvements, optimizations and bug fixes from 3.4 branch. In particular:</p>

<ul>

    <li>ONNX parser has been added to OpenCV DNN module. It supports various classification networks, such as AlexNet, Inception v2, Resnet, VGG etc. The tiny YOLO v2 object detection network is also partially supported.</li>

    <li>A few other notable DNN improvements:</li>

    <ul>

        <li>Mask RCNN support and the example</li>

        <li>Faster object detection when using Intel Inference Engine (a part of Intel OpenVINO)</li>

        <li>Several stability improvements in the OpenCL backend.</li>

    </ul>

    <li>Fast QR code detector (~80FPS @ 640x480 resolution on Core i5 desktop). By 4.0 gold we plan to add the QR code decoder as well, so that we have a complete solution.</li>

    <li>Constantly expanding set of SSE4-, AVX2- and NEON-optimized kernels via so called “wide universal intrinsics”.</li>

</ul>


<p>Besides, OpenCV 4.0 alpha includes some exclusive features, such as:</p>

<ul>

    <li>OpenCV is C++11 library now and it requires C++11 compliant compiler. Therefore, some nice features like parallel_for with lambda functions, convenient iteration over cv::Mat, initialization of cv::Mat by listing its elements etc. are available by default.</li>

    <li>The standard <code>std::string</code> and <code>std::shared_ptr</code> replaced hand-crafted <code>cv::String</code> and <code>cv::Ptr</code>. Our parallel_for can now use the pool of std::threads as the backend.</li>

    <li>The legacy C API from OpenCV 1.x (using <code>CvMat</code>, <code>IplImage</code>, etc.) is partially excluded; the cleanup should mostly be finished by OpenCV 4.0 gold.</li>

    <li>Added basic FP16 support (the new <code>CV_16F</code> type has been added).</li>

    <li>CPU- and GPU-accelerated KinFu live 3d dense reconstruction algorithm has been included into <i>opencv_contrib</i>.</li>

    <li>HPX parallel backend (thanks to Jakub Golinowski)</li>

    <li>The new chessboard detector (thanks to Alexander Duda)</li>

</ul>

<p>Overall, OpenCV 4.0 alpha release includes 85 patches, including 28 massive merge requests from 3.4 branch.</p>

<p>Please note that even though the release should be quite stable, quite a few changes in OpenCV API and implementation are yet to be done before 4.0 final.</p>
