short: OpenCV 3.0 alpha is released, with refined
    API, greatly improved performance on CPU, transparent acceleration on GPU and
    tons of new functionality in the new contrib repository.
title: OpenCV 3.0 alpha
---
<p>It has been almost 5 years since OpenCV 2.0 has been released, which brought the completely new C++ API and started the new epoch of extensive growth of the project. During the whole 2.x lifecycle we added support of new platforms, including iOS and Android, added GPU acceleration via CUDA and OpenCL, provided complete interface to Python and Java users and built our state-of-art continuous integration system based on github and buildbot. As a result, we now have very stable OpenCV 2.4.x that's been used in many companies and universities all over the world.</p>
<p>And now we are happy to announce the start of new season, OpenCV 3.x. In which there will be no such radical rehearsal as in 2.0, and yet it's substantial enough pile of changes and brings a lot of new opportunities for us and you, our great OpenCV community.</p>
<p>The detailed changelog is provided, as usual, at <a href="http://code.opencv.org/projects/opencv/wiki/ChangeLog">our development site</a> and let us touch some of the highlights:<br />
<br />
1. Change in the project architecture. Since very beginning OpenCV was one solid project, built and shipped as a whole, and that was good strategy for many years. However, with constantly growing functionality, including bleeding-edge algorithms published a few minutes before a pull request has been submitted to our repository, and increasing number of contributors (thank you all very much, guys!) we came to the same conclusion and decision as many other big project - the solid model does not work anymore. Let's use use the core + plugins architecture then!</p>
<p>In addition to <a href="http://github.com/itseez/opencv">our main repository</a> and the additional <a href="http://github.com/itseez/opencv_extra">"test data" repository</a>, we are now glad to introduce <a href="http://github.com/itseez/opencv_contrib">http://github.com/itseez/opencv_contrib</a>, where we put a lot of exciting functionality, including already known face recognition and text detection, but also text recognition, new-age edge detectors, state-of-art inpainting, depth maps processing, new optical flow and tracking algorithms etc. </p>
<p>What's common and what's different between opencv and opencv_contrib?</p>
<ul>
<li>They are both served by <a href="{{ site.link_ci }}">our continuous integration system</a> (note the combo-box on the top of the page), although unit tests for contrib are not regularly run yet.</li>
<li>All or some of these extra modules can be built using our build system, pass OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=<opencv_contrib_root>/modules to CMake.</opencv_contrib_root></li>
<li>Documentation for contrib is automatically generated and is available at docs.opencv.org/master.  It will be made better shaped and more organized by OpenCV 3.0 beta and final release.</li>
<li>The main opencv is Itseez-supported code, it will have very stable API and probably just a little innovation.</li>
<li>opencv_contrib is the place where most of the experimental code is put, some parts may change API and it's where you are welcome to contribute your new exciting algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Thanks to support from Intel and AMD companies, we made GPU acceleration of many vision algorithms very easily accessible to our users. The technology is nicknamed T-API ("transparent API"). A separate guide on this topic is being prepared, but you are welcome to take a look at and try out <a href="{{ site.link_gh }}/opencv/tree/master/samples/tapi">our t-api samples</a> to see how it works.</p>
<p>3. Intel corporation gave us another exciting present. A subset of <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-ipp">Intel Integrated Performance Primitives (IPP)</a> is linked by default into OpenCV and is available at no charge for all our users. And that includes the license to redistribute applications that use IPP-accelerated OpenCV. As you may see, for quite a few image processing functions we achieved very noticeable speedup with IPP (where IPP is compared with OpenCV built with all possible optimizations turned on):</p>

<p>This is alpha, so expect some glitches, such as partially broken Python bindings, a few failing tests etc. Those items are in progress and also we appreciate your feedback very much.</p>
<p><b>OpenCV 3.0 beta</b> is expected in middle of this fall and the <b>OpenCV 3.0 final release</b> should be ready by the Christmas/New Year holidays.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />
