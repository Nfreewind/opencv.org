<p>Thank you all for all those (positive!) answers! We decided to stop the survey after 2K answers as it is enough for us to analyze:) The summary is <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-fmuyGnQGOtBAUQ0MV5Ly6P4KaBKvQAES6d6VOMCtOU/viewanalytics">here</a><br /> and you can get the raw results in that <a href="{{ site.link_dl }}/misc/survey_2013_answers.ods">LibreOffice file</a>.</p>
<p>We will analyse results and will use them for decision making process in future.</p>
<p>Now, it's time for us to prepare the kickstarter, stay tuned on our different channels!</p>
